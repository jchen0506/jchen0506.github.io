# MQM 2022

The 10th Triennial Conference on Molecular Quantum Mechanics will be held on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Virginia, June 26-July 1, 2022. The meeting will cover a broad range of subjects in computational and theoretical chemistry, including:

+ Density Functional Theory
+ Post Hartree-Fock Methods
+ Multireference Approaches
+ Relativistic Effects
+ Excited States
+ Solvation Effects
+ Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics
+ Condensed-Phase Approaches
+ Chemical Reactivity and Unconventional Methods
+ Mathematical Foundations and Numerical Aspects

MQM 2022 will engage approximately 300 participants and thus will have a very high international profile. A group of worldwide leading scientists will deliver historical, plenary, and invited lectures at the forefront of the field, and we anticipate three large poster sessions with presentations by outstanding Ph.D. students and postdocs. Consequently, we expect MQM also to be highly attractive for industrial sponsors who will find an audience for their products and who would like an opportunity to meet outstanding students who are the next generation of computational molecular scientists.

The conference is primarily targeted to an audience of researchers in molecular quantum mechanics including students, postdocs, and senior scientists. The conference will be of great benefit for those in industry, academia, and national laboratories who need to stay abreast of the current state of the art of the broad field of theoretical and computational chemistry.
